## 1. Processes & Threads

- **Q1. Process vs Thread?**  
  - Process â†’ independent program with its own memory.  
  - Thread â†’ lightweight execution inside a process, shares heap/code, own stack.  

- **Q2. What is context switching?**  
  - Saving current process state â†’ loading next process state.  
  - Enables multitasking, but costly.  

- **Q3. What happens when you run a program?**  
  - Compile â†’ Executable â†’ Loader loads â†’ OS creates process â†’ Execution begins at `main()`.  

- **Q4. Multitasking vs Multiprocessing vs Multithreading?**  
  - Multitasking â†’ CPU time-slicing.  
  - Multiprocessing â†’ Multiple CPUs/cores.  
  - Multithreading â†’ Multiple threads in one process.  

- **Q5. Can two threads share memory?**  
  - Yes â†’ share **heap + code**, but separate **stacks**.  
    - Stack = Fast, temporary storage (function-local variables).
    - Heap = Flexible, long-lived storage (objects, dynamic memory).

## 2. Scheduling & CPU Management

- **Q6. Scheduling algorithm?** â†’ OS policy to decide which process gets CPU.  

- **Q7. FCFS vs SJF vs Round Robin?**  
  - FCFS â†’ First come, first served.  
  - SJF â†’ Shortest burst first.  
  - RR â†’ Fixed time slice per process.  

- **Q8. Priority scheduling & starvation?**  
  - High-priority runs first.  
  - Starvation = low-priority waits forever â†’ solved via **Aging**. (Gradually increase the priority of a waiting process over time, thus every process eventually gets CPU time) 

- **Q9. Preemptive vs Non-preemptive?**  
  - Preemptive â†’ OS can stop a process (e.g., RR).  
  - Non-preemptive â†’ Process runs till done (e.g., FCFS).

## 3. Memory Management

- **Q10. Stack vs Heap?**  
  - Stack â†’ function calls, locals.  
  - Heap â†’ dynamic memory.  

- **Q11. Virtual memory?**  
  - Abstraction â†’ each process gets logical memory space.  

- **Q12. Paging vs Segmentation?**  
  - Paging â†’ fixed-size blocks.  
  - Segmentation â†’ variable-size logical blocks.  

- **Q13. Page fault?**  
  - Accessing a page not in RAM â†’ OS loads from disk.  

- **Q14. Thrashing?**  
  - Too many page faults â†’ CPU spends time swapping, not executing.

## 4. Deadlocks & Concurrency

- **Q15. Deadlock?** â†’ Processes wait forever for each otherâ€™s resources.  

- **Q16. Coffmanâ€™s 4 conditions:**  
  1. Mutual exclusion  
  2. Hold & wait  
  3. No preemption  
  4. Circular wait  

- **Q17. Deadlock vs Starvation vs Livelock?**  
  - Deadlock â†’ all stuck.  
  - Starvation â†’ some never execute.  
  - Livelock â†’ keep changing state, no progress.  

- **Q18. Handling deadlocks?**  
  - Prevention, Detection + Recovery, Avoidance (Bankerâ€™s Algo).  

- **Q19. Mutex vs Semaphore vs Monitor?**  
  - Mutex â†’ one thread at a time.  
  - Semaphore â†’ counter for multiple resources.  
  - Monitor â†’ abstraction with locks + condition vars.

## 5. File Systems & I/O

- **Q20. File management?** â†’ OS uses file system metadata (inodes/FAT).  

- **Q21. Absolute vs Relative path?**  
  - Absolute â†’ full path from root.  
  - Relative â†’ from current directory.  

- **Q22. Inode?** â†’ Stores file metadata (size, perms, owner, blocks).  

- **Q23. Buffering vs Caching?**  
  - Buffering â†’ temp storage during transfer.  
  - Caching â†’ keep frequently accessed data.  

- **Q24. Polling vs Interrupt-driven I/O?**  
  - Polling â†’ CPU keeps checking device.  
  - Interrupt â†’ device notifies CPU.  

---

## 6. Synchronization & IPC

- **Q25. IPC methods?** â†’ Pipes, Shared Memory, Message Queues, Sockets.  

- **Q26. Cooperating vs Independent process?**  
  - Cooperating â†’ affects/is affected.  
  - Independent â†’ no effect on others.  

- **Q27. IPC in same machine vs across network?**  
  - Same â†’ Shared memory, Pipes.  
  - Network â†’ Sockets.  

- **Q28. Semaphore real-world use?**  
  - Controlling multiple printers for many users.

## 7. General OS Concepts

- **Q29. Kernel types?**  
  - Monolithic â†’ all services in kernel.  
  - Microkernel â†’ minimal kernel, rest in user space.  

- **Q30. System call?** â†’ Program requests OS service (e.g., `fork()`, `open()`).  

- **Q31. User mode vs Kernel mode?**  
  - User â†’ limited access.  
  - Kernel â†’ full access.  

- **Q32. Ctrl+C in terminal?**  
  - Sends **SIGINT** signal â†’ process terminates unless handled.  

- **Q33. Compilation vs Linking vs Loading vs Execution?**  
  - Compilation â†’ source â†’ object code.  
  - Linking â†’ combine objects + libs.  
  - Loading â†’ load into RAM.  
  - Execution â†’ CPU runs it.
