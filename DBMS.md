## 1. Basics of DBMS

- **Q1. What is a DBMS? How is it different from a file system?**  
  - DBMS â†’ software to store, manage, retrieve data efficiently.  
  - File system â†’ simple storage, no data integrity, redundancy issues.  

- **Q2. Advantages of DBMS?**  
  - Reduced data redundancy, improved consistency, security, concurrent access, backup & recovery.  

- **Q3. Types of DBMS?**  
  - Hierarchical, Network, Relational (RDBMS), Object-oriented.  

- **Q4. What is a relational model?**  
  - Data stored in tables (relations) with rows (tuples) and columns (attributes).  

- **Q5. Database schema vs instance?**  
  - Schema â†’ structure of database (fixed).  
  - Instance â†’ actual data at a particular time.
 
- **What are tables, rows, and columns?**
  - Table = collection of rows (records) and columns (attributes). Row = single record, Column = attribute of record.

## 2. SQL & Queries

- **Q6. Difference between DDL, DML, DCL, TCL?**  
  - DDL â†’ CREATE, ALTER, DROP (structure)  
  - DML â†’ SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE (data)  
  - DCL â†’ GRANT, REVOKE (permissions)  
  - TCL â†’ COMMIT, ROLLBACK (transactions)  

- **Q7. INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, FULL OUTER JOIN?**  
  - INNER â†’ only matching rows  
  - LEFT â†’ all rows from left + matched from right  
  - RIGHT â†’ all rows from right + matched from left  
  - FULL OUTER â†’ all rows from both tables  

- **Q8. WHERE vs HAVING?**  
  - WHERE â†’ filters rows **before aggregation**  
  - HAVING â†’ filters **after aggregation**  

- **Q9. Subquery: Correlated vs Non-correlated?**  
  - Correlated â†’ depends on outer query, evaluated per row  
  - Non-correlated â†’ independent, runs once  

- **Q10. UNION vs UNION ALL?**  
  - UNION â†’ removes duplicates  
  - UNION ALL â†’ keeps duplicates  

- **Q11. Views?**  
  - Virtual table based on query, does not store data physically  

- **Q12. Stored procedures, triggers, functions?**  
  - Stored procedure â†’ precompiled SQL statements  
  - Trigger â†’ automatically executed on events  
  - Function â†’ returns value, can be used in queries

## 3. Keys & Constraints

- **Q13. Primary key?** â†’ Unique identifier for table row, cannot be NULL.  
- **Q14. Foreign key?** â†’ References primary key in another table for referential integrity.  
- **Q15. Candidate key, alternate key, super key?**  
  - Super key â†’ uniquely identifies a row  
  - Candidate key â†’ minimal super key  
  - Alternate key â†’ candidate key not chosen as primary key  
- **Q16. Unique key vs Primary key?** â†’ Unique allows NULLs (in most DBMS), Primary does not.  
- **Q17. Constraints?** â†’ Rules on table data: NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, DEFAULT, PRIMARY, FOREIGN.

## 4. Normalization & ER Modeling

- **Q18. What is normalization?** â†’ Process to remove redundancy and dependency.  
- **Q19. 1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF?**  
  - 1NF â†’ atomic attributes  
  - 2NF â†’ 1NF + no partial dependency  
  - 3NF â†’ 2NF + no transitive dependency  
  - BCNF â†’ stricter 3NF, resolves anomalies in composite keys  

- **Q20. Denormalization?** â†’ Combining tables to improve query performance.  
- **Q21. ER diagram?** â†’ Visual representation: entities, attributes, relationships.  
- **Q22. Weak vs Strong entities?** â†’ Weak depends on strong entity, has partial key.

## 5. Indexing & Performance

- **Q23. Index?** â†’ Data structure to speed up retrieval.  
- **Q24. Clustered vs Non-clustered index?**  
  - Clustered â†’ table rows stored in index order  
  - Non-clustered â†’ separate index points to rows  

- **Q25. B-Tree index?** â†’ Balanced tree, logarithmic search time.  
- **Q26. Hash index?** â†’ Uses hash function for quick lookup, no order guaranteed.  
- **Q27. Pros & cons of indexing?**  
  - Pros: Faster search  
  - Cons: Slower insert/update/delete, extra storage

## 6. Transactions & Concurrency

- **Q28. Transaction?** â†’ Logical unit of work on DB, all-or-nothing.  
- **Q29. ACID properties?**  
  - Atomicity â†’ all or nothing  
  - Consistency â†’ maintains DB constraints  
  - Isolation â†’ concurrent transactions donâ€™t interfere  
  - Durability â†’ committed data persists  

- **Q30. Commit & Rollback?** â†’ Commit saves changes, Rollback undoes changes.  
- **Q31. Concurrency control?** â†’ Prevents conflicts when multiple transactions run.  
- **Q32. Pessimistic vs Optimistic control?**  
  - Pessimistic â†’ locks resources  
  - Optimistic â†’ checks for conflicts before commit  

- **Q33. Deadlock in DB?** â†’ Two transactions wait for each otherâ€™s locks â†’ no progress. Resolved using wait-die/wound-wait or timeout.  

---

## 7. Storage & Recovery

- **Q34. Database storage structure?** â†’ Tablespaces â†’ Pages â†’ Blocks  
- **Q35. Log-based recovery?** â†’ Uses transaction logs to recover DB after crash  
- **Q36. Backup types?** â†’ Full, Incremental, Differential  
- **Q37. Replication vs Mirroring?** â†’ Replication â†’ copies DB to multiple nodes  
  - Mirroring â†’ real-time exact copy  

---

## 8. Misc / Advanced Basics

- **Q38. OLTP vs OLAP?** â†’ OLTP â†’ transactions, frequent updates  
  - OLAP â†’ analytics, read-heavy  

- **Q39. SQL vs NoSQL?** â†’ SQL â†’ structured, relational  
  - NoSQL â†’ unstructured, document/column/key-value  

- **Q40. Relation, Tuple, Attribute?** â†’ Table = relation, row = tuple, column = attribute  
- **Q41. Foreign key cascade update/delete?** â†’ Automatically updates/deletes referencing rows  
- **Q42. Soft delete vs hard delete?** â†’ Soft â†’ mark as deleted  
  - Hard â†’ remove from DB
